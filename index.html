										<h2>My Profile</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Personal Information</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>Name: David Nguyen</li>
										<li>Email: s3816170@student.rmit.edu.au</li>
										<li>Nationality: Australian</li>
										<li>Ethnicity: Vietnamese</li>
										<li>Education: Bachelor of Information Technology - RMIT University (current)</li>
										<li>Languages spoken: English(first language), Vietamese(intermediate proficiency)</li>
										<li>Interesting hobby: I started bike riding after many years of not riding, during the COVID-19 lockdowns. It has now developed into an off-road mountain biking hobby and a constant money pit as I'm always upgrading.</li>
									</ul>
									<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
									<p>My initial interest into computers was around the time I was introduced to the game platform 'Steam', which was when I transitioned from console gaming to computer gaming. PC gamers tend to obsess over the latest and highest spec parts, and I was no different. As you can probably imagine, this was difficult as student, so instead I had to find the best "bang for buck" parts within budget. Through researching and the whole process of building my first PC, I familiarised myself with computer hardware and what each part's role was and how they interacted with one another, but at that point, it was just a hobby. It wasn't until later on when I came across the television series 'Mr Robot' that I developed a deeper interest in IT, and more specifically cyber security, and towards the end of my schooling when I started thinking about courses and careers, that I began to consider a profession in the IT field. I have yet to decide on a specific profession, but I have interests in cyber security, data science and UX/UI design. Currently, I have some basic experience in a few coding languages including Python, HTML, CSS and SQLite and web-based tools such as Figma, all of which I expect to build on as I progress through my course.</p>
									<p>I chose to study at RMIT due to it's reputation for practical, industry-based learning as well as the abundant facilities and support that is available to students. I also had friends who were already students at RMIT who recommended it. The campus location also appealed to me for the social aspect of student life as it is right in the heart of the Melbourne CBD. </p>
									<p>During my studies at RMIT, I expect to not only learn about and develop hard skills such as coding/programming in various languages, computer hardware/software, networking, etc but also the soft skills including communication, working in a team and problem solving. I believe this would adequately prepare me for when I begin my career in IT.</p>
